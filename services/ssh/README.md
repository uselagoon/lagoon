This service is part of amazee.io Lagoon, a Docker build and deploy system for
OpenShift & Kubernetes. Please reference our [documentation] for detailed
information on using, developing, and administering Lagoon.

# SSH (`ssh`)

Acts as the main entrypoint for all SSH-related connections and commands for
Lagoon projects. All connections are authenticated via the Lagoon API using
standard SSH public/private keys. Authenticated connections can: 1) request a
token that can be used to authenticate to the Lagoon API or 2) connect via SSH
to a Lagoon project environment.

This service is typically transparent to end users since connections are handled
by Drush for Drupal projects, but direct connections can be made for non-Drush
workflows.
