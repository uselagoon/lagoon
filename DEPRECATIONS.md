# Lagoon Project Deprecation Announcements

## Overview
This file is a constantly updated central tracker for deprecations across the suite of Lagoon products. As Lagoon continues to evolve, we occasionally need to replace, rename or retire existing processes, tools or configuration. Where this may impact a user's processes or procedures, we intend to outline a timeframe to allow any necessary changes to be made.

Deprecations will be tracked by the release they are announced in, and then updated when the actual deprecation occurs. All deprecations should provide a rough timeline (in months or releases). Releases will normally only be listed here if they include planned deprecations.
