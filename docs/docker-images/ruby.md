!!! Tip
    We stop updating and publishing EOL Ruby images usually with the Lagoon release that comes after the officially communicated EOL date: [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/releases/](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/releases/). Previous versions will remain available.

## Lagoon adaptions

The default exposed port of ruby containers is port `3000`.

Lagoon has no "pre-defined" type for Ruby services, they should be configured with the `lagoon.type: generic` and a port set with `lagoon.port: 3000`

## `docker-compose.yml` snippet

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
ruby:
    build:
    # this configures a build from a Dockerfile in the root folder
        context: .
        dockerfile: Dockerfile
        labels:
        # tells Lagoon this is a generic service, configured to expose port 3000
            lagoon.type: generic
            lagoon.port: 3000
        ports:
        # local development only
        # this exposes the port 3000 with a random local port
        # find it with `docker-compose port ruby 3000`
            - "3000"
```
