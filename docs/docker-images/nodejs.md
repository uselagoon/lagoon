# Node.js

The [Lagoon `Node.js` Docker image](https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-images/tree/main/images/node). Based on [the official Node Alpine images](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/).

## Supported Versions

We ship 2 versions of Node.js images: the normal `node:version` image and the `node:version-builder`.

The builder variant of those images comes with additional tooling that is needed when you build Node.js apps (such as the build libraries, npm and Yarn). For a full list check out their [Dockerfile](https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-images/tree/main/images/node-builder).

* 12 \(available for compatibility only, no longer officially supported\) - `uselagoon/node-12`
* 14 \(available for compatibility only, no longer officially supported\) - `uselagoon/node-14`
* 16 [Dockerfile](https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-images/blob/main/images/node/16.Dockerfile) (Security Support until September 2023) - `uselagoon/node-16`
* 18 [Dockerfile](https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-images/blob/main/images/node/18.Dockerfile) (Security Support until April 2025) - `uselagoon/node-18`
* 20 [Dockerfile](https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-images/blob/main/images/node/20.Dockerfile) (Security Support until April 2026) - `uselagoon/node-20`

!!! Tip
    We stop updating EOL Node.js images usually with the Lagoon release that comes after the officially communicated EOL date: [https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).

## Lagoon adaptions

The default exposed port of Node.js containers is port `3000`.

Persistent storage is configurable in Lagoon, using the `lagoon.type: node-persistent`. See [the docs](../using-lagoon-the-basics/docker-compose-yml.md#persistent-storage) for more info

Use the following labels in your `docker-compose.yml` file to configure it:

* `lagoon.persistent` = use this to define the path in the container to use as persistent storage - e.g. /app/files.
* `lagoon.persistent.size` = this to tell Lagoon how much storage to assign this path.
* If you have multiple services that share the same storage, use this
`lagoon.persistent.name` = (optional) use this to tell Lagoon to use the storage defined in another named service.

## `docker-compose.yml` snippet

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
    node:
        build:
            # this configures a build from a Dockerfile in the root folder
            context: .
            dockerfile: Dockerfile
        labels:
            # tells Lagoon this is a node service, configured with 500MB of persistent storage at /app/files
            lagoon.type: node-persistent
            lagoon.persistent: /app/files
            lagoon.persistent.size: 500Mi
        ports:
        # local development only
            # this exposes the port 3000 with a random local port
            # find it with `docker-compose port node 3000`
            - "3000"
        volumes:
        # local development only
            # mounts a named volume (files) at the defined path for this service to replicate production
            - files:/app/files
```
