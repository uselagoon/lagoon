## Environment Variables

Some options are configurable via [environment
variables](../using-lagoon-advanced/environment-variables.md).

| Environment Variable | Default           | Description                                                                                                                 |
| :------------------- | :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |
| OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS | -Xms512m -Xmx512m | Sets the memory usage of the OpenSearch container. Both values need be the same value or OpenSearch will not start cleanly. |

## Known issues

On Linux-based systems, the start of the OpenSearch container may fail due to a low `vm.max_map_count` setting.

```bash title="Error"
opensearch_1  | ERROR: [1] bootstrap checks failed
opensearch_1  | [1]: max virtual memory areas vm.max_map_count [65530] is too low, increase to at least [262144]
```
