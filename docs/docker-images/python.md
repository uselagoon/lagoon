!!! Tip
    We stop updating and publishing EOL Python images usually with the Lagoon release that comes after the officially communicated EOL date: [https://devguide.python.org/versions/#versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions/#versions). Previous published versions will remain available.

## Lagoon adaptions

The default exposed port of Python containers is port `8800`.

Persistent storage is configurable in Lagoon, using the `lagoon.type: python-persistent`. See [the docs](../using-lagoon-the-basics/docker-compose-yml.md#persistent-storage) for more info

Use the following labels in your `docker-compose.yml` file to configure it:
`lagoon.persistent` = use this to define the path in the container to use as persistent storage - e.g. /app/files
`lagoon.persistent.size` = this to tell Lagoon how much storage to assign this path

If you have multiple services that share the same storage, use this
`lagoon.persistent.name` = (optional) use this to tell Lagoon to use the storage defined in another named service

## `docker-compose.yml` snippet

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
python:
    build:
    # this configures a build from a Dockerfile in the root folder
        context: .
        dockerfile: Dockerfile
    labels:
    # tells Lagoon this is a python service, configured with 500MB of persistent storage at /app/files
        lagoon.type: python-persistent
        lagoon.persistent: /app/files
        lagoon.persistent.size: 500Mi
    ports:
    # local development only
          # this exposes the port 8800 with a random local port
          # find it with `docker-compose port python 8800`
        - "8800"
    volumes:
    # local development only
        # mounts a named volume (files) at the defined path for this service to replicate production
        - files:/app/files
```
