# docker-compose.yml

The `docker-compose.yml` file is used by Lagoon to:

* Learn which services/containers should be deployed.
* Define how the images for the containers are built.
* Define additional configurations like persistent volumes.

Docker Compose (the tool) is very strict in validating the content of the YAML file, so we can only do configuration within `labels` of a service definition.

!!! warning
    Lagoon only reads the labels, service names, image names and build definitions from a `docker-compose.yml` file. Definitions like: ports, environment variables, volumes, networks, links, users, etc. are IGNORED.

This is intentional, as the `docker-compose` file is there to define your local environment configuration. Lagoon learns from the `lagoon.type` the type of service you are deploying and from that knows about ports, networks and any additional configuration that this service might need.

Here a straightforward example of a `docker-compose.yml` file for Drupal:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
x-lagoon-project:
  # Lagoon project name (leave `&lagoon-project` when you edit this)
  &lagoon-project drupal-example

x-volumes:
  &default-volumes
    # Define all volumes you would like to have real-time mounted into the docker containers
    volumes:
      - .:/app:delegated

x-environment:
  &default-environment
    LAGOON_PROJECT: *lagoon-project
    # Route that should be used locally, if you are using pygmy, this route *must* end with .docker.amazee.io
    LAGOON_ROUTE: http://drupal-example.docker.amazee.io
    # Uncomment if you want to have the system behave as it will in production
    #LAGOON_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE: production
    # Uncomment to enable Xdebug and then restart via `docker compose up -d`
    #XDEBUG_ENABLE: "true"

x-user:
  &default-user
    # The default user under which the containers should run. Change this if you are on linux and run with another user than ID `1000`
    user: '1000'

services:

  nginx:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: nginx.dockerfile
    labels:
      lagoon.type: nginx-php-persistent # (1)
      lagoon.persistent: /app/web/sites/default/files/

  php:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: php.dockerfile
    labels:
      lagoon.type: nginx-php-persistent # (2)
      lagoon.name: nginx
      lagoon.persistent: /app/web/sites/default/files/

  mariadb:
    image: uselagoon/mariadb-10.11-drupal
    labels:
      lagoon.type: mariadb
```

1. Note the [multi-container pods](docker-compose-yml.md#multi-container-pods) here.
2. Note the [multi-container pods](docker-compose-yml.md#multi-container-pods) here.

## Basic settings

`x-lagoon-project`:

This is the machine name of your project, define it here. We’ll use “drupal-example.”

`x-volumes`:

This tells Lagoon what to mount into the container. Your web application lives in `/app`, but you can add or change this if needed.

`x-environment`:

1. Here you can set your local development URL. If you are using pygmy, it must end with `.docker.amazee.io`.
2. If you want to exactly mimic the production environment, uncomment `LAGOON_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE: production`.
3. If you want to enable Xdebug, uncomment `DEBUG_ENABLE: "true"`.

`x-user`:

You are unlikely to need to change this, unless you are on Linux and would like to run with a user other than `1000`.

## **`services`**

This defines all the services you want to deploy. _Unfortunately,_ Docker Compose calls them services, even though they are actually containers. Going forward we'll be calling them services, and throughout this documentation.

The name of the service (`nginx`, `php`, and `mariadb` in the example above) is used by Lagoon as the name of the Kubernetes pod (yet another term - again, we'll be calling them services) that is generated, plus also any additional Kubernetes objects that are created based on the defined `lagoon.type`, which could be things like services, routes, persistent storage, etc.

Please note that service names adhere to the [RFC 1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035) DNS label standard. Service names must:

* contain at most 63 characters
* contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters or '-'
* start with an alphabetic character
* end with an alphanumeric character

!!! warning
    Once you have set the name of a service, do NOT rename it. This will cause all kind of havoc in your containers and break things.

### Docker Images

#### `build`

If you want Lagoon to build an image for your service during every deployment, you can define it here:

`build`

* `context`: The build context path that should be passed on into the `docker build` command.
* `dockerfile`: Location and name of the Dockerfile that should be built.

!!! warning
    Lagoon does NOT support the short version of `build: <Dockerfile>` and will fail if it finds such a definition.

If you're building a derived image and need to ensure the base image is always updated, add the
base image as a label for the service: `lagoon.base.image: container.reg/my/baseimage:latest`. The
value supports environment variable replacement, for example `baseimage:${MY_BASEIMAGE_TAG:-latest}`.

#### `image`

If you want to use an existing image, instead of building one, define it via `image`.

### Types

Lagoon needs to know what type of service you are deploying in order to configure the correct Kubernetes or OpenShift objects.

This is done via the `lagoon.type` label. There are many different types to choose from. Check [Service Types](../concepts-advanced/service-types.md) to see all of them and their additional configuration possibilities.

#### Skip/Ignore containers

If you'd like Lagoon to ignore a service completely - for example, you need a container only during local development - give it the type `none`.

### Persistent Storage

Some containers need persistent storage. Lagoon allows for each container to have a maximum of one persistent storage volume attached to the container. You can configure the container to request its own persistent storage volume (which can then be mounted by other container), or you can tell the container to mount the persistent storage created by another container.

In many cases, Lagoon knows where that persistent storage needs to go. For example, for a MariaDB container, Lagoon knows that the persistent storage should be put into `/var/lib/mysql` , and puts it there automatically without any extra configuration to define that. For some situations, though, Lagoon needs your help to know where to put the persistent storage:

* `lagoon.persistent` - The **absolute** path where the persistent storage should be mounted (the above example uses `/app/web/sites/default/files/` which is where Drupal expects its persistent storage).
* `lagoon.persistent.name` - Tells Lagoon to not create a new persistent storage for that service, but instead mounts the persistent storage of another defined service into this service.
* `lagoon.persistent.size` - The size of persistent storage you require (Lagoon usually gives you minimum 5G of persistent storage, if you need more, define it here).
* `lagoon.persistent.class` - By default Lagoon automatically assigns the right storage class for your service (like SSDs for MySQL, bulk storage for Nginx, etc.). If you need to overwrite this, you can do so here. This is highly dependent on the underlying Kubernetes/OpenShift that Lagoon runs on. Contact {{ defaults.helpstring }} for this.

See the [Additional Volumes](#additional-volumes) section on how to add more volumes

### Auto-generated Routes

The docker-compose.yml file also supports per-service enabling and disabling of [autogenerated routes](./lagoon-yml.md#routes)

* `lagoon.autogeneratedroute: false` label will stop a route from being automatically created for that service. It can be applied to all services with autogenerated routes, but is mostly useful for the [`basic`](../concepts-advanced/service-types.md#basic) and [`basic-persistent`](../concepts-advanced/service-types.md#basic-persistent) service types when used to create an additional internal-facing service for a database service or similar. The inverse is also true - it will enable an auto-generated route for a service when the .lagoon.yml file [disables them](lagoon-yml.md#autogenerated-routes).

## Additional Volumes

In situations where more than one persistent volume is required by a service (or services), Lagoon can support the creation of multiple additional volumes.

To do this, the volume should be created in the docker-compose.yml with a `lagoon.type` label - currently only "persistent" is supported.

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml volumes snippet"
volumes:
  extravol:
    labels:
      lagoon.type: persistent
```

This volume can then be referenced in each service that requires it, along with the path.

Currently, only [bulk](../concepts-advanced/storage-types.md#bulk) storage types are supported for additional volumes. To find out which service types support additional volumes, see [Service Types](../concepts-advanced/service-types.md)

### Add additional volumes to an existing non `-persistent` service type

If you have a `basic` or other supported standalone service type and you want to add volumes, you can use the additional volumes to do this without chaning the service type to a `-persistent` type.

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml volume usage snippet"
services:
  basic:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: basic.dockerfile
    labels:
      lagoon.type: basic
      lagoon.volumes.data.path: /data # basic-persistent provides a default volume, this needs to be defined
      lagoon.volumes.extravol.path: /extra
    volumes: # these volumes are ignored by lagoon, only the labels above are consumed to handle volume mapping
      - data:/data:delegated
      - extravol:/extra

volumes:
  data:
    labels:
      lagoon.type: persistent
  extravol:
    labels:
      lagoon.type: persistent
      lagoon.backup: false
```

### Add additional volume to an existing `-persistent` service type

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml volume usage snippet"
services:
  basic:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: basic.dockerfile
    labels:
      lagoon.type: basic-persistent
      lagoon.persistent: /data # basic-persistent provides a default volume, this needs to be defined
      lagoon.volumes.extravol.path: /extra
    volumes: # these volumes are ignored by lagoon, only the labels above are consumed to handle volume mapping
      - ./data:/data:delegated
      - extravol:/extra

volumes:
  extravol:
    labels:
      lagoon.type: persistent
      lagoon.backup: false
```
Note that the original volume created for this service still exists.

### Supported persistent volume flags
* The default size is 5Gi - but can be modified with a `lagoon.persistent.size: XXGi` label on the volume.
* By default, Lagoon will back up all persistent volumes, but this can be disabled with a `lagoon.backup: false` label on the volume.

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml volumes snippet"
volumes:
  extravol:
    labels:
      lagoon.type: persistent
      lagoon.persistent.size: 10Gi
      lagoon.backup: false
```

### Default persistent volumes
* If a service type provides a default persistent volume (nginx-php-persistent, basic-persistent, node-persistent, python-persistent), it will be created and named as the name of the service (unless the lagoon.persistent.name label is assigned).
* If a volume defined in the volumes block is also named the same as a default volume would be, it will be ignored and only the default volume will be created.
* If a lagoon.volumes.${volume_name}.path is also defined on a service that has a default volume (or a volume linked to it using the lagoon.persistent.name label, it will also be ignored and the value of the lagoon.persistent path will be used.
### Ignored volume
* If a volume defined in the volumes block has a label lagoon.type: none it will not be created.
* If a volume defined in the volumes block has a label lagoon.type of a type (currently only persistent), but it is not consumed by any service using a lagoon.volumes.${volume_name}.path, then the volume will not be created.
### Maximum number of volumes
* Currently a hard-coded limit of 6 volumes is in place, this may be made configurable in the future.
### Supported service types
Currently, the only service types that support additional volumes are the following

* basic / basic-persistent
* worker / worker-persistent
* node / node-persistent
* python / python-persistent
* nginx / nginx-php / nginx-php-persistent
* cli / cli-persistent

Adding a volume to any other type will result in an error during a build.

## Additional Service Ports

If you have a service that has many ports, you can use the `lagoon.service.usecomposeports: true` label to inform Lagoon to use the ports defined on the service.

!!! info
    Only TCP based ports will be allowed to have a route attached, but UDP ports can be used for internal communications.

For example, if you have a `basic` service that requires ports `8080` and `10009`.

* port 8080 could be a HTTP based port and you want to route to this using a route in `.lagoon.yml`
* port 10009 could be used by other services within the environment for internal communications


You would define your service to consume the `ports` like so:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml service port snippet"
version: '2'
services:
  custom:
    build:
      context: internal/testdata/basic/docker
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    labels:
      lagoon.type: basic
      lagoon.service.usecomposeports: true
    ports:
      - "8080"
      - "10009"
```

The first port in the list of ports will be the "default" port for the service, so standard routes like so will route to the default port.
An example `.lagoon.yml` is show how this looks the same as any other standard service route.

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml default port route"
environments:
  main:
    routes:
      - custom:
        - example.com
```

Alternatively, if you wanted to also have a route specifically for port 10009, you could define the route like so in your `.lagoon.yml`.

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml default and alternative port route"
environments:
  main:
    routes:
      - custom-10009:
        - otherport.example.com
```

!!! info
    You can define both the "default" route and a custom port route together, as long as they have different domains used.

## Multi-Container Pods

Kubernetes and OpenShift don't deploy plain containers. Instead, they deploy pods, with each one or more containers. Usually Lagoon creates a single pod with a container inside for each defined `docker-compose` service. For some cases, we need to put two containers inside a single pod, as these containers are so dependent on each other that they should always stay together. An example for such a situation is the PHP and NGINX containers that both contain PHP code of a web application like Drupal.

For these cases, it is possible to tell Lagoon which services should stay together, which is done in the following way (remember that we are calling containers `services` because of `docker-compose`:

1. Define both services with a `lagoon.type` that expects two services (in the example this is `nginx-php-persistent` defined on the `nginx` and `php` services).
2. Link the second service with the first one, defining the label `lagoon.name` of the second one with the first one. (in the example this is done with defining `lagoon.name: nginx`).

This will cause Lagoon to realize that the `nginx` and `php` containers are combined in a pod that will be called `nginx`.

!!! warning
    Once you have set the `lagooon.name` of a service, do NOT rename it. This will cause all kind of havoc in your containers and break things.

Lagoon still needs to understand which of the two services is the actual individual service type (`nginx` and `php` in this case). It does this by searching for service names with the same name that are given by the type, so `nginx-php-persistent` expects one service with the name `nginx` and one with `php` in the `docker-compose.yml.` If for any reason you want to use different names for the services, or you need for than one pod with the type `nginx-php-persistent` there is an additional label `lagoon.deployment.servicetype` which can be used to define the actual service type.

An example:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
nginx:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: nginx.dockerfile
    labels:
      lagoon.type: nginx-php-persistent
      lagoon.persistent: /app/web/sites/default/files/
      lagoon.name: nginx # If this isn't present, Lagoon will use the container name, which in this case is nginx.
      lagoon.deployment.servicetype: nginx
php:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: php.dockerfile
    labels:
      lagoon.type: nginx-php-persistent
      lagoon.persistent: /app/web/sites/default/files/
      lagoon.name: nginx # We want this service to be part of the NGINX pod in Lagoon.
      lagoon.deployment.servicetype: php
```

In the example above, the services are named `nginx` and `php` (but you can call them whatever you want). The `lagoon.name` tells Lagoon which services go together - all of the services with the same name go together.

In order for Lagoon to realize which one is the `nginx` and which one is the `php` service, we define it via `lagoon.deployment.servicetype: nginx` and `lagoon.deployment.servicetype: php`.

## Docker Compose v2 compatibility

!!! bug
    Note that while using older versions of Docker Compose V2 locally, you may experience some known issues - these have been resolved in later releases (v2.17.3 onwards).

The resolution for these errors is usually to update (or [install a later version](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) of) the version of Docker Compose you are using, either standalone or by upgrading the version of Docker Desktop you're using.  See the Docker Desktop [release notes](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/) for more information

``` shell title="Docker Compose output indicating depends_on error"
Failed to solve with frontend dockerfile.v0: failed to create LLB definition: pull access denied, repository does not exist or may require authorization

or

Failed to solve: drupal9-base-cli: pull access denied, repository does not exist or may require authorization: server message: insufficient_scope: authorization failed`
```

* These are resolved in Docker Compose v2.13.0.
* This message means that your build has tried to access a Docker image that hasn't been built yet. As BuildKit builds in parallel, if you have a Docker image that inherits another one (as we do in Drupal with the CLI).
* You can also use the [target](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/build/#target) field inside the build to reconfigure as a multi-stage build.
* If you are already running a newer Docker Compose version, this error may be because you're defaulting to using a docker-container build context with buildx. You should make sure that `docker buildx ls` shows the docker builder as default, not a docker-container based one. Check the docs on Docker buildx [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/buildx_use/).

``` shell title="Docker Compose output indicating volumes_from error"
no such service: container:amazeeio-ssh-agent
```

* This is resolved in Docker Compose v2.17.3.
* This message means that the service that provides SSH access into locally running containers runs outside of your Docker Compose stack and is inaccessible.
* The section can also be removed from your `docker-compose.yml` file if you don't require SSH access from inside your local environment.

## BuildKit and Lagoon

BuildKit is a toolkit for converting source code to build artifacts in an efficient, expressive and repeatable manner.

With the release of Lagoon v2.11.0, Lagoon now provides support for more advanced BuildKit-based docker compose builds, and in Lagoon v2.21.0, BuildKit is now enabled by default for all builds. To specifically disable BuildKit for your Project or Environment, add `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0` as a build-time variable to your Lagoon project or environment.

## Docker Compose Errors in Lagoon Builds

See the [Lagoon Build Errors page](../using-lagoon-the-basics/lagoon-build-errors-and-warnings.md#docker-compose-errors) for how to resolve common build errors with Docker Compose.

## Common Docker Compose Issues

This section outlines some of the more common Docker Compose errors, and how to remedy them. These may present in local development, or as [Lagoon Build Errors and Warnings](../using-lagoon-the-basics/lagoon-build-errors-and-warnings.md#docker-compose-errors).

### Dual Mapping keys

``` shell title="Docker Compose output indicating mapping key error"
ERR: yaml: unmarshal errors: line 22: mapping key "<<" already defined at line 21
```

Early releases of the Lagoon examples contained a pair of YAML aliases attached to services to provide volumes and user code. Newer releases of Docker Compose will report this as an error. While all examples have now been updated, there may be some older codebases around that need updating.

This error arises from Docker Compose not knowing what it is inserting into the array, so just assuming it may be duplicate.

If your `docker-compose.yml` contains one or more of this (or similar) code blocks, you will be affected.

``` yaml title="Docker Compose error with dual mapping keys"
...
    << : [*default-volumes]
    << : [*default-user]
...
```

The corrected version combines both aliases into a single mapping key - you'll need to remedy all occurrences.

``` yaml title="Docker Compose correct insertion of multiple alias mapping keys"
...
    << : [*default-volumes, *default-user]
...
```

## Deprecated

These settings have been deprecated and should be removed from use in your `docker-compose.yml`.

* `services.[name].labels.lagoon.rollout`
* `services.[name].labels.lagoon.template`
