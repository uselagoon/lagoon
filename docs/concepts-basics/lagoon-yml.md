# .lagoon.yml

The `.lagoon.yml` file is the central file to set up your project. It contains configuration in order to do the following:

* [Define routes for accessing your sites](lagoon-yml.md#routes).
* [Define pre-rollout tasks](lagoon-yml.md#pre-rollout-tasks).
* [Define post-rollout tasks](lagoon-yml.md#post-rollout-tasks).
* [Set up SSL certificates](lagoon-yml.md#ssl-configuration-tls-acme).
* [Add cron jobs for environments](lagoon-yml.md#environmentsnamecronjobs).

The `.lagoon.yml` file must be placed at the root of your Git repository.

## General Settings

### Docker Compose YAML

Tells the build script which Docker Compose YAML file should be used, in order to learn which services and containers should be deployed. This defaults to `docker-compose.yml`, but could be used for a specific Lagoon Docker Compose YAML file if needed.

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
docker-compose-yaml: docker-compose.yml
```

### Git SHA

This setting allows you to enable injecting the deployed Git SHA into your project as an environment variable. By default this is disabled. Setting the value to `true` sets the SHA as the environment variable `LAGOON_GIT_SHA`.

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
environment_variables:
  git_sha: true
```

## Routes

Routes are used to direct traffic to services. Each service in an environnment
can have routes, in which the domain names are defined manually or
automatically. The top level `routes` section applies to all routes in all
environments.

### Autogenerated Routes

This allows you to configure automatically created routes. [Manual
routes](#environmentsnameroutes) are defined per environment.

!!! info
    The autogenerated route functionality (enabled by default) will publish the names of the Lagoon project and environment in the autogenerated URL.

    Therefore, if you are using autogenerated routes, please take care when naming your projects / PRs / environments not to put sensitive information in the names.

* `enabled`: Set to `false` to disable autogenerated routes. Default is `true`.
* `allowPullrequests`: Set to `true` to override `enabled: false` for pull
  requests.

  ```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
  routes:
    autogenerate:
      enabled: false
      allowPullrequests: true
  ```

* `insecure`: Configures HTTP connections. Default is `Allow`.
  * `Allow`: Route will respond to HTTP and HTTPS.
  * `Redirect`: Route will redirect any HTTP request to HTTPS.

* `prefixes`: Configure prefixes for the autogenerated routes of each
  environment. This is useful for things like language prefix domains, or a
  multi-domain site using the Drupal `domain` module.

  ```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
  routes:
    autogenerate:
      prefixes:
      - www
      - de
      - fr
      - it
  ```

### Path Based Routes

Path based routes allows you to define paths on a route to a different backend. This can be used if you have a separate backend within the environment that you want to route traffic to on the same domain as another service within your environment.

!!! warning
    Path based routes can get quite complex and should only be used if you have a need to use them.

Here is an example `.lagoon.yml` file that shows how path based routes can be defined. There is support for global autogenerated routes, per environment autogenerated routes, and custom routes.

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml path based routes"
docker-compose-yaml: docker-compose.yml

# if an environment has `autogeneratePathRoutes` defined like `environments.main.autogeneratePathRoutes`
# then thes global lagoon yaml `routes.autogenerate.pathRoutes` are ignored
routes:
  autogenerate:
    pathRoutes:
      - fromService: nginx
        toService: node
        path: /api/v1

environments:
  main:
    # path routes for autogenerated routes for this environment only
    autogeneratePathRoutes:
      - fromService: nginx
        toService: node
        path: /api/v1
    routes:
      - nginx:
        - a.example.com:
            pathRoutes:
              - toService: node
                path: /api/v1
```

#### Autogenerated Routes

It is possible to configure global autogenerated routes, these would apply to ALL environments that this `.lagoon.yml` file would cover.

Additionally, per environment autogenerated route configurations are supported, the fields are the same, just where they are defined is different.

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml autogenerated path based routes"
routes:
  autogenerate:
    pathRoutes:
      - fromService: nginx
        toService: node
        path: /api/v1

environments:
  main:
    # path routes for autogenerated routes for this environment only
    autogeneratePathRoutes:
      - fromService: nginx
        toService: node
        path: /api/v1
```
!!! info
    If the per environment path routes are defined on an environment, any global defined ones are ignored.

The supported fields for autogenerated path routes are:

* `fromService` - the autogenerated route for the service you want to add the path based route to
* `toService` - the backend service you want to route to
* `path` - the path to send to the `toService`

#### Custom Routes

It is possible to turn on path based routes for a specific route too, the following `.lagoon.yml` example shows how.

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml custom route path based routes"
environments:
  main:
    routes:
      - nginx:
        - a.example.com:
            pathRoutes:
              - toService: node
                path: /api/v1
```
The fields are the same, except that you can omit `fromService` due to the way that custom routes are defined already associated to a `fromService` in their normal configuration.

#### Conditions

##### Autogenerated Route configurations

If the global path routes for autogenerated routes are defined, but an environment has overrides, the global defined path routes are ignored by that environment.

##### Additional Service Ports

If the docker compose label `lagoon.service.usecomposeports=true` has been defined on a service, then the service name with the port number as a suffix to any ports beyond the default (first defined port) must be used as the `toService`. See [Additional Service Ports](docker-compose-yml.md/#additional-service-ports) for more information on this label.

The following `docker-compose.yml` has an example of this label and the ports. This would create the default service port named `node` referencing port 1234, but also another service `node-4321`. If you need to create a path based route to port 4321, you would need to define the `toService` as `node-4321`.

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml path based routes"
services:
  nginx:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: basic.dockerfile
    labels:
      lagoon.type: nginx
      lagoon.service.usecomposeports: true
    ports:
      - '8080'
  node:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: basic.dockerfile
    labels:
      lagoon.type: basic
      lagoon.service.usecomposeports: true
    ports:
      - '1234'
      - '4321'
```
Then you could create a route that would route `a.example.com` traffic to the `nginx` service. But any traffic destined for `a.example.com/api/v1` would go to the `node` service on port `4321`

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml custom route path based routes"
environments:
  main:
    routes:
      - nginx:
        - a.example.com:
            pathRoutes:
              - toService: node-4321
                path: /api/v1
```

##### URLs

The `path` defined in the `pathRoute` will be passed to whichever `toService` is defined in all URL queries. This means if you're using the `path` defined as `/api/v1` for example, then you may need to cater for this in your backend depending on how your backend is built.

##### Path Types

In Lagoon, currently only `Prefix` type is supported on ingress (see [Ingress path types](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#path-types)).

## Tasks

There are different type of tasks you can define, and they differ in when exactly they are executed in a build flow:

### Pre-Rollout Tasks

Here you can specify tasks which will run against your project _after_ all images have been successfully built, but _before_:

* Any running containers are updated with the newly built images.
* Any other changes are made to your existing environment.

This feature enables you to, for example, create a database dump before updating your application.
This can make it easier to roll back in case of a problem with the deploy.

!!! Info
    The pre-rollout tasks run in the _existing pods before they are updated_, which means:

    * Changes made to your Dockerfile since the last deploy will not be visible when pre-rollout tasks run.
    * If there are no existing containers (e.g. on the initial deployment of a new environment), pre-rollout tasks are skipped.

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
tasks:
  pre-rollout:
    - run:
        name: a pre rollout task
        command: |
            ### perform an action
        service: cli
```

### Post-Rollout Tasks

Here you can specify tasks which need to run against your project, _after_:

* All images have been successfully built.
* All containers are updated with the new images.
* All containers are running have passed their readiness checks.

Common uses for post-rollout tasks include running `drush updb`, `drush cim`, or clearing various caches.

* `name`
  * The name is an arbitrary label for making it easier to identify each task in the logs.
* `command`
  * Here you specify what command should run. These are run in the WORKDIR of each container, for Lagoon images this is `/app`. Keep this in mind if you need to `cd` into a specific location to run your task.
* `service`
  * The service in which to run the task. If following our Drupal example, this will be the CLI container, as it has all your site code, files, and a connection to the database. Typically you do not need to change this.
* `container`
  * If the service has multiple containers (e.g. `nginx-php`), you will need to specify which container in the pod to connect to (e.g. the `php` container within the `nginx` pod).
* `shell`
  * In which shell the task should be run. By default `sh` is used, but if the container also has other shells \(like `bash`, you can define it here\). This is useful if you want to run some small if/else bash scripts within the post-rollouts. [See the example below](#example-post-rollout-tasks) to learn how to write a script with multiple lines.
* `when`
  * The "when" clause allows for the conditional running of tasks. It expects an expression that will evaluate to a true/false value which determines whether the task should be run.

Note: If you would like to disable pre/post-rollout tasks during a deployment, you can set either of the following as [buildtime env vars](../concepts-advanced/environment-variables.md#buildtime).

* `LAGOON_PREROLLOUT_DISABLED=true`
* `LAGOON_POSTROLLOUT_DISABLED=true`

#### Example post-rollout tasks

Here are some useful examples of post-rollout tasks that you may want to use or adapt for your projects.

Run only if Drupal not installed:

```bash title=".lagoon.yml"
tasks:
  post-rollout:
    - run:
      name: IF no Drupal installed
      command: | # (1)
        if tables=$(drush sqlq "show tables like 'node';") && [ -z "$tables" ]; then
          #### whatever you like
        fi
      service: cli
      shell: bash
```

1. This shows how to create a multi-line command.

Different tasks based on branch name:

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
tasks:
  post-rollout:
    - run:
        name: Different tasks based on branch name
        command: |
            ### Runs if current branch is not 'production'
        service: cli
        when: LAGOON_GIT_BRANCH != "production"
```

Run shell script:

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
tasks:
  post-rollout:
    - run:
        name: Run Script
        command: './scripts/script.sh'
        service: cli
```

Target specific container in pod:

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
tasks:
  post-rollout:
    - run:
        name: show php env variables
        command: env
        service: nginx
        container: php
```

Drupal & Drush 9: Sync database & files from master environment:

```bash title=".lagoon.yml"
tasks:
  post-rollout:
    - run:
        name: Sync DB and Files from master if we are not on master
        command: |
          # Only if we don't have a database yet
          if tables=$(drush sqlq 'show tables;') && [ -z "$tables" ]; then
              drush sql-sync @lagoon.master @self # (1)
              drush rsync @lagoon.master:%files @self:%files -- --omit-dir-times --no-perms --no-group --no-owner --chmod=ugo=rwX
          fi
        service: cli
        when: LAGOON_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE != "production"
```

1. Make sure to use the correct aliases for your project here.

## Backup Retention

### Production Monthly

Specify the number of monthly backups Lagoon should retain for your project's production environment\(s\).

The global default is `0` if this value is not specified.

### Production Weekly

Specify the number of weekly backups Lagoon should retain for your project's production environment\(s\).

The global default is `6` if this value is not specified.

### Production Daily

Specify the number of daily backups Lagoon should retain for your project's production environment\(s\).

The global default is `7` if this value is not specified.

### Production Daily

Specify the number of hourly backups Lagoon should retain for your project's production environment\(s\).

The global default is `0` if this value is not specified.

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
backup-retention:
  production:
    monthly: 0
    weekly: 6
    daily: 7
    hourly: 0
```

## Backup Schedule

Specify the backup schedule for this project. Accepts cron-compatible syntax with the notable exception that the `Minute` block must be the letter `M`. Any other value in the `Minute` block will cause the Lagoon build to fail. This allows Lagoon to randomly choose a specific minute for these backups to happen, while users can specify the remainder of the schedule down to the hour.

The global default is `M H(22-2) * * *` if this value is not specified.

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
backup-schedule:
  production: "M H(22-2) * * *"
```

!!! Info "Timezones:"

    Backup schedules use the cluster's local timezone.

## Environments

Environment names match your deployed branches or pull requests. This allows for each environment to have a different config. In our example it will apply to the `main` and `staging` environment.

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
environments:
  main:
    <environment stanzas>
```

### Environment Routes

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vQxh87F3fW4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Manual routes are domain names that are configured per environment to direct
traffic to a service. Since all environments get [automatically created
routes](#routesautogenerate) by default, it is typical that manual routes are
only setup for the production environment, using the main domain of the
project's website like `www.example.com`.

!!! Tip
    Since Lagoon has no control over the manual routes, you'll need to ensure
    the DNS records are configured properly at your DNS provider. You can likely
    set a `CNAME` record to point to the automatic route.

The first element after the environment is the target service, `nginx` in our
example. This is how we identify which service incoming requests will be sent
to.

The simplest route is `example.com`, as seen in our [example
`.lagoon.yml`](#example-lagoonyml) - you can see it has no additional
configuration. This will assume that you want a Let's Encrypt certificate for
your route and no redirect from HTTPS to HTTP.

In the `"www.example.com"` example below, we see three more options (also
notice the `:` at the end of the route and that the route is wrapped in `"`,
that's important!):

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
environments:
  main:
    routes:
      - nginx:
        - "www.example.com":
            tls-acme: true
            insecure: Redirect
            hstsEnabled: true
```

#### SSL Configuration `tls-acme`

!!! Warning
    If you switch from `tls-acme: true` to `tls-acme: false` this will remove any previously
    generated certificates for this route. This could result in unexpected behaviour if you're
    using an external CDN and do any certificate pinning.

* `tls-acme`: Configures automatic TLS certificate generation via Let's Encrypt.
  Default is `true`, set to `false` to disable automatic certificates.
* `insecure`: Configures HTTP connections. Default is `Allow`.
  * `Allow`: Route will respond to HTTP and HTTPS.
  * `Redirect`: Route will redirect any HTTP request to HTTPS.
* `hstsEnabled`: Adds the `Strict-Transport-Security` header. Default is
  `false`.
* `hstsMaxAge`: Configures the `max-age` directive. Default is `31536000` (1
  year).
* `hstsPreload`: Sets the `preload` directive. Default is `false`.
* `hstsIncludeSubdomains`: Sets the `includeSubDomains` directive. Default is
  `false`.

!!! Info
    If you plan to switch from a SSL certificate signed by a Certificate
    Authority (CA) to a Let's Encrypt certificate, it's best to get in touch
    with {{ defaults.helpstring }} to oversee the transition.

#### Monitoring a specific path

!!! Info
    Lagoon does not provide any monitoring capabilties out of the box, only labels and annotations. Check with {{ defaults.helpstring }} if monitoring is supported.

Lagoon will add the label `lagoon.sh/primaryIngress=true` to the first route defined in the `.lagoon.yml` file for an environment.

If a specific path on a route requires monitoring, define `monitoring-path` with the path to use. Lagoon will add this path to the annotation `monitor.stakater.com/overridePath` to the route.

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
- "www.example.com":
      monitoring-path: "/bypass-cache"
```

!!! Info
    The annotation `monitor.stakater.com/overridePath` used by monitoring-path references the stakater monitoring controller, this is not used by Lagoon. This annotation will eventually be replaced with a `lagoon.sh` scoped annotation in the future.

#### Ingress annotations

!!! Warning
    Route/Ingress annotations are only supported by projects that deploy into clusters that run nginx-ingress controllers! Check with {{ defaults.helpstring }} if this is supported.

* `annotations` can be a YAML map of [annotations supported by the nginx-ingress controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/). This is specifically useful for easy redirects and other configurations.

##### Restrictions

Some annotations are disallowed or partially restricted in Lagoon.
The table below describes these rules.

If your `.lagoon.yml` contains one of these annotations it will cause a build failure.

| Annotation                                          | Notes                                                                                    |
| ---                                                 | ---                                                                                      |
| `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-snippet`          | Disallowed                                                                               |
| `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet` | Restricted to `rewrite`, `add_header`, `set_real_ip`, and `more_set_headers` directives. |
| `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/modsecurity-snippet`   | Disallowed                                                                               |
| `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/server-snippet`        | Restricted to `rewrite`, `add_header`, `set_real_ip`, and `more_set_headers` directives. |
| `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/stream-snippet`        | Disallowed                                                                               |
| `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex`             | Disallowed                                                                               |

##### Ingress annotations redirects

In this example any requests to `example.ch` will be redirected to `https://www.example.ch` while keeping folders or query parameters intact \(`example.com/folder?query` -&gt; `https://www.example.ch/folder?query`\).

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
- "example.ch":
    annotations:
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/permanent-redirect: https://www.example.ch$request_uri
- www.example.ch
```

You can of course also redirect to any other URL not hosted on Lagoon, this will direct requests to `example.de` to `https://www.google.com`

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
- "example.de":
    annotations:
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/permanent-redirect: https://www.google.com
```

##### Trusted Reverse Proxies

!!! warning
    Kubernetes will only process a single `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/server-snippet` annotation. Please ensure that if you use this annotation on a non-production environment route that you also include the `add_header X-Robots-Tag "noindex, nofollow";` annotation as part of your server-snippet. This is needed to stop robots from crawling development environments as the default server-snippet set to prevent this in development environments in the ingress templates will get overwritten with any `server-snippets` set in `.lagoon.yml`.

Some configurations involve a reverse proxy \(like a CDN\) in front of the Kubernetes clusters. In these configurations, the IP of the reverse proxy will appear as the `REMOTE_ADDR` `HTTP_X_REAL_IP` `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` headers field in your applications. The original IP of the requester can be found in the `HTTP_X_ORIGINAL_FORWARDED_FOR` header.

If you want the original IP to appear in the `REMOTE_ADDR` `HTTP_X_REAL_IP` `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` headers, you need to tell the ingress which reverse proxy IPs you want to trust:

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
- "example.ch":
    annotations:
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/server-snippet: |
        set_real_ip_from 1.2.3.4/32;
```

This example would trust the CIDR `1.2.3.4/32` \(the IP `1.2.3.4` in this case\). Therefore if there is a request sent to the Kubernetes cluster from the IP `1.2.3.4` the `X-Forwarded-For` Header is analyzed and its contents injected into `REMOTE_ADDR` `HTTP_X_REAL_IP` `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` headers.

### Environment Types

The Lagoon build process checks the `lagoon.type` label from the `docker-compose.yml` file in order to learn what type of service should be deployed \(read more about them in the [documentation of `docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose-yml.md#types)\).

Sometimes you might want to override the **type** just for a single environment, and not for all of them. For example, if you want a standalone MariaDB database \(instead of letting the Service Broker/operator provision a shared one\) for your non-production environment called `develop`:

`service-name: service-type`

* `service-name` is the name of the service from `docker-compose.yml` you would like to override.
* `service-type` the type of the service you would like to use in your override.

Example for setting up MariaDB\_Galera:

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
environments:
  develop:
    types:
      mariadb: mariadb-single
```

### Environment Autogenerated Routes

This allows for any environments to get autogenerated routes when route autogeneration is disabled.

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
routes:
  autogenerate:
    enabled: false
environments:
  develop:
    autogenerateRoutes: true
```

### Environment Cronjobs

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yd_JfDyfbR0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Cron jobs must be defined explicitly for each environment, since it is typically
not desirable to run the same ones for all environments. Depending on the
defined schedule, cron jobs may run as a Kubernetes native `CronJob` or as an
in-pod cron job via the crontab of the defined service.

#### Cron Job Example

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
cronjobs:
  - name: Hourly Drupal Cron
    schedule: "M * * * *" # Once per hour, at a random minute.
    command: drush cron
    service: cli
  - name: Nightly Drupal Cron
    schedule: "M 0 * * *" # Once per day, at a random minute from 00:00 to 00:59.
    command: drush cron
    service: cli
```

* `name`: Any name that will identify the purpose and distinguish it from other
  cron jobs.
* `schedule`: The schedule for executing the cron job. Lagoon uses an extended
  version of the crontab format. If you're not sure about the syntax, use a
  [crontab generator](https://crontab.guru/).

  * You can specify `M` for the minute, and your cron job will run once per
    hour at a random minute (the same minute each hour), or `M/15` to run it
    every 15 mins, but with a random offset from the hour (like
    `6,21,36,51`). It is a good idea to spread out your cron jobs using this
    feature, rather than have them all fire off on minute `0`.
  * You can specify `H` for the hour, and your cron job will run once per day
    at a random hour (the same hour every day), or `H(2-4)` to run it once
    per day within the hours of 2-4.

!!! Info "Timezones:"

    * The default timezone for cron jobs is UTC.
    * Native cron jobs use the timezone of the node, which is UTC.
    * In-pod cron jobs use the timezone of the defined service, which
      can be configured to something other than UTC.

* `command`: The command to execute. This executes in the `WORKDIR` of the
  service. For Lagoon images, this is `/app`.

!!! info "Cronjob Implementation"
    If a cronjob runs approximately every 30 minutes or less, Lagoon will run it in the defined service, else a kubernetes native cronjob is used.
    Further information can be found [here](https://github.com/uselagoon/build-deploy-tool/pull/444).


!!! warning
      Cronjobs may run in-pod, via crontab, which [doesn't support multiline
      commands](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/crontab.5.html). If
      you need a complex or multiline cron command, you must put it in a
      script that can be used as the command. Consider whether a [pre- or post-rollout task](#tasks) would work.

!!! danger
      Cronjobs run in Kubernetes pods, which means they can be interrupted due to pod rescheduling.
      Therefore when creating a cronjob you must ensure that the command can be safely interrupted and re-run at the next cron interval.

* `service`: Which service of your project to run the command in. For most
  projects, this should be the `cli` service.

## Polysite

In Lagoon, the same Git repository can be added to multiple projects, creating what is called a polysite. This allows you to run the same codebase, but allow for different, isolated, databases and persistent files. In `.lagoon.yml` , we currently only support specifying custom routes for a polysite project. The key difference from a standard project is that the `environments` becomes the second-level element, and the project name the top level.

To utilize this, you will need to:

1. Create two (or more) projects in Lagoon, each configured with the same Git URL and production branch, **named per your .lagoon.yml** (i.e `poly-project1` and `poly-project2` below)
2. Add the deploy keys from each project to the Git repository.
3. Configure the webhook for the repository (if required) - you can then push/deploy. Note that a push to the repository will simultaneously deploy all projects/branches for that Git URL.

### Polysite Example

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
poly-project1:
  environments:
    main:
      routes:
        - nginx:
          - project1.com
poly-project2:
  environments:
    main:
      routes:
        - nginx:
          - project2.com
```

## Specials

### API

???+ Info
    If you run directly on amazee.io hosted Lagoon you will not need this key set.

With the key `api` you can define another URL that should be used by the Lagoon CLI and `drush` to connect to the Lagoon GraphQL API. This needs to be a full URL with a scheme, like: `http://localhost:3000` This usually does not need to be changed, but there might be situations where {{ defaults.helpstring }} tells you to do so.

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
api: http://localhost:3000
```

### SSH

???+ Info
    If you run directly on amazee.io hosted Lagoon you will not need this key set.

With the key `ssh` you can define another SSH endpoint that should be used by the Lagoon CLI and `drush` to connect to the Lagoon remote shell service. This needs to be a hostname and a port separated by a colon, like: `localhost:2020` This usually does not need to be changed, but there might be situations where {{ defaults.helpstring }} tells you to do so.

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
ssh: localhost:2020
```

### Container Registries

The `container-registries` block allows you to define your own private container registries to pull custom or private images.

To use a private container registry, you will need a `username`, `password`, and optionally the `url` for your registry. If you don't specify a `url` in your YAML, it will default to using Docker Hub. We also recommend adding a `description` to your container-registry entries to provide a bit of information about them, some examples are provided.

There are 2 ways to define the username and password used for your registry user.

* Define them as environment variables in the API
* Hardcode them in the `.lagoon.yml` file (we don't recommend this though)

#### Environment variables method

Firstly, define the `container-registries` in your `.lagoon.yml`, you don't need to define the username or password here. If you do use a custom registry, you will still need to provide the `url`, for example:

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
container-registries:
  docker-hub:
    description: "username and password consumed from environment variables for the default docker.io registry"
  my-custom-registry:
    description: "username and password consumed from environment variables for my custom registry"
    url: my.own.registry.com
  another-custom-registry:
    description: "password consumed from environment variables for my other registry"
    username: myotheruser
    url: my.other.registry.com
```

If you do define a username in the `.lagoon.yml` you don't need to add the associated variable, but if you do add the variable, the value of the variable will be prefered.

Next, create environment variables in the Lagoon API with the type `container_registry`:

* `lagoon add variable -p <project_name> -N <registry_username_variable_name> -V <username_goes_here> -S container_registry`
* `lagoon add variable -p <project_name> -N <registry_password_variable_name> -V <password_goes_here> -S container_registry`
* \(see more on [Environment Variables](../concepts-advanced/environment-variables.md)\)

The name of the variables should be the name of the registry defined in the `.lagoon.yml` file, it should be:

* uppercase
* replace `-` with `_`
* have the prefix `REGISTRY_`
* have the suffix of `_USERNAME` or `_PASSWORD`.

Some examples of this are:

* `dockerhub` would become `REGISTRY_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `REGISTRY_DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD`
* `docker-hub` would become `REGISTRY_DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME` and `REGISTRY_DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD`
* `my-custom-registry` would become `REGISTRY_MY_CUSTOM_REGISTRY_USERNAME` and `REGISTRY_MY_CUSTOM_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`
* lowercased versions may still work if there are no `-` in them, for example `REGISTRY_dockerhub_USERNAME`, but the uppercased version will always be chosen above others.

???+ "Legacy method of defining registry password"
    A previous method that allowed for the password to be defined using an environment variable, with the name of the variable to be defined in the `.lagoon.yml` file like so:
    ```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
    container-registries:
      docker-hub:
        username: dockerhubuser
        password: MY_DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD
    ```
    > the username needs to be provided in this file too, unless the supported variable for defining the username is provided.

    The variable can then ba added to the API like so

    * `lagoon add variable -p <project_name> -N MY_DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD -V <password_goes_here> -S container_registry`

    While we will continue to support this method, it may be deprecated in the future, we will ensure that warnings are presented within builds to give time for users to change to the supported method.

    If a supported variable password is provided, it will be used instead of the custom named variable.

#### Hardcoded values method
You can also define the password directly in the `.lagoon.yml` file in plain text, however we do not recommend this.

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
container-registries:
  docker-hub:
    description: "the default docker.io registry credentials"
    username: dockerhubuser
    password: MySecretPassword
  my-custom-registry:
    description: "the credentials for my own registry"
    url: my.own.registry.com
    username: mycustomuser
    password: MyCustomSecretPassword
```


### Consuming a custom or private container registry image

To consume a custom or private container registry image, you need to update the service inside your `docker-compose.yml` file to use a build context instead of defining an image:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
services:
  mariadb:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.mariadb
```

Once the `docker-compose.yml` file has been updated to use a build, you need to create the `Dockerfile.<service>` and then set your private image as the `FROM <repo>/<name>:<tag>`

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
FROM dockerhubuser/my-private-database:tag
```

## Example `.lagoon.yml`

This is an example `.lagoon.yml` which showcases all possible settings. You will need to adapt it to your project.

```yaml linenums="1" title=".lagoon.yml"
docker-compose-yaml: docker-compose.yml

## Deprecated

These settings have been deprecated and should be removed from use in your `.lagoon.yml`.

* `routes.autogenerate.insecure`

    The `None` option is equivalent to `Redirect`.

* `environments.[name].monitoring_urls`
* `environments.[name].rollouts`
* `environments.[name].routes.[service].[route].hsts`
* `environments.[name].routes.[service].[route].insecure`

    The `None` option is equivalent to `Redirect`.

* `environments.[name].templates`
