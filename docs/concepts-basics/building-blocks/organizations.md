# Organizations

An _organization_ is an entity which can contain one or more projects, groups, users, and notifications. Organizations help control access to projects, making it easy to create groups, add and remove users, and assign groups to projects.

Organizations add a layer of structure to help imitate life - for example, you may be a project manager who creates an organization to reflect the team working on a specific site. So that organization would contain the project or projects that make up that site, all of the people who need access to work on the site as users in a group called _developers_, and maybe another group of people who just need access to Lagoon to view the site and any issues, called _viewers_, each with the appropriate roles.

Organizations have a quota to limit the number of projects, groups, notifications, and environments that can be assigned to it. If you need to change this quota, please contact {{ defaults.helpstring }}.
