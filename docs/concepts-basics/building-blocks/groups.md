# Groups

_Groups_ are made up of users who have roles. An organization can have one or more groups. Each project can be assigned one or more groups. Groups can be assigned to multiple projects. Groups are created independently of projects, and then assigned to them.

Organizations have a quota to limit the number of groups assigned to it. If you need to change the quota, please contact {{ defaults.helpstring }}.
