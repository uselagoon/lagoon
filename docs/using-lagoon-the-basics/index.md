# Overview

## Requirements

### Docker

To run a Lagoon Project, your system must meet the requirements to run Docker. We suggest installing the latest version of Docker for your workstation. You can download Docker [here](https://www.docker.com/get-docker). We also suggest allowing Docker at least **4 CPUs** and **4 GB RAM**.

### Local Development Environments

TL;DR: install and start `pygmy`:

```bash
brew tap pygmystack/pygmy; # (1)
brew install pygmy;
pygmy up
```

1. HomeBrew is the easiest way to install Pygmy, see the docs for more info.

[Pygmy](https://github.com/pygmystack/pygmy/) is a container stack for local development, developed collaboratively with the Lagoon team.

## Overview of Lagoon Configuration Files

### `.lagoon.yml`

This is the main file that will be used by Lagoon to understand what should be deployed, as well as many other things. See [documentation for `.lagoon.yml`](lagoon-yml.md).

### `docker-compose.yml`

This file is used by `Docker Compose` to start your local development environment. Lagoon also uses it to understand which of the services should be deployed, which type, and how to build them. This happens via `labels`. See [documentation for `docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose-yml.md).

### Dockerfiles

Some Docker images and containers need additional customizations from the provided images. This usually has two reasons:

1. **Application code**: Containers like NGINX, PHP, Node.js, etc, need the actual programming code within their images. This is done during a Docker build step, which is configured in a Dockerfile. Lagoon has full support for Docker, and therefore also allows you full control over the resulting images via Dockerfile customizations.
2. **Customization of images**: Lagoon also allows you to customize the base images according to your needs. This can be to inject an additional environment variable, change a service configuration, or even install additional tools. We advise caution with installing additional tools to the Docker images, as you will need to maintain any adaptions in the future!

All images are pushed to [https://hub.docker.com/u/uselagoon](https://hub.docker.com/u/uselagoon). We suggest always using the latest tag \(like `uselagoon/nginx:latest`\) as they are kept up to date in terms of features and security.

If you choose to use a specific Lagoon version of an image like `uselagoon/nginx:20.10.0` or `uselagoon/node-10:20.10.0` it is your own responsibility to upgrade the version of the images as soon as a new Lagoon version is released!
