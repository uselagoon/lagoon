# Drupal on Lagoon

Lagoon was built to host Drupal sites (no, seriously, it was - at least initially!)

In this section you'll find more information on the various services that have been customised for use with Drupal.

## `drupal_integrations` Drupal scaffolding package

The `drupal_integrations` package, available on [pacakagist](https://packagist.org/packages/amazeeio/drupal_integrations) extends Drupal's core-composer-scaffold for use on Lagoon. It also provides additional Drush command `drush la` to retreive the Drush aliases for your Lagoon project.

## `lagoon-logs` Drupal module

The `lagoon_logs` module, availalble on [drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/project/lagoon_logs) provides zero-configuration logging for Drupal on Lagoon.
