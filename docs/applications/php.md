## Introduction

Lagoon supports a wide range of PHP-based applications, such as [Drupal](../drupal/index.md), Laravel, [Wordpress](wordpress.md), Magento and Symfony.

More information on how to adapt your PHP project to run on Lagoon can be found in our [PHP-cli Docker Images](../docker-images/php-cli.md) and [PHP-FPM Docker Images](../docker-images/php-fpm.md) sections.
