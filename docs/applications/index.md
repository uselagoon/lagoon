description: Applications that can be run on Lagoon
---

# A wide range of Applications, Frameworks and Languages are supported by Lagoon

Lagoon broadly classifies three levels in the application stack:

## Languages

The core building blocks of any Lagoon project, these are usually provided by Lagoon-specific images.

## Frameworks

These take those base images, and add in the necessary logic, tools and packages needed to serve a website, or drive an application.

## Applications

Usually built on top of Frameworks, this is the layer that content editors or developers will interact with to shape the finished product.

-----------------------

When we reference any repositories for use on Lagoon, we usually refer to them in three ways:

## Templates

These are fully-functional, cloneable starter repositories, maintained and updated regularly, ready to be extended and used with little customization.

## Examples

These are fully functional repositories, maintained and updated regularly, but may require some effort to make work for your individual project.

## Demos

These are repositories that have been built as a demonstration, and are usable for some of the concepts within, but aren't routinely maintained or updated.
