# Node.js

## Introduction

Lagoon provides [Node.js images](https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-images/tree/main/images/node) that are based on [the official Node Alpine images](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/).

More information on how to adapt your project to run on Lagoon can be found in our [Node.js Docker Images](../docker-images/nodejs.md) section.
