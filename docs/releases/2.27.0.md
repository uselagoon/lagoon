## Release Notes

### Lagoon Core

#### Lagoon Files Bucket Region

This release included an update to an AWS S3 library in the API. If you're using an AWS bucket for Lagoon files, you may need to now set a value in your lagoon-core helmchart values for `s3FilesRegion`. The default region is `us-east-1`, if your buckets are in a different region, you may need to configure `s3FilesRegion` to point to your specific region.

If you're using Google Cloud, or another S3 compatible storage provider, you may not need to set this. Check with your bucket provider to see if they require a region when used with the `aws-sdk-v3` library.
