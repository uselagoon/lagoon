## Release Notes

### Lagoon Beta UI

We've made the new beta UI available to preview in Lagoon installations. It's disabled by default, but can be enabled by setting `betaUI.enabled: true` in your lagoon-core Helm values. This is the next iteration of the Lagoon UI and will eventually replace the current UI.

## Deprecations

### Lagoon Core

#### Bitbucket and Open Distro integrations

We've removed the Bitbucket sync script and Open Distro integration that were deprecated in Lagoon [2.29.0](https://docs.lagoon.sh/releases/2.29.0/). These integrations are no longer maintained or included in Lagoon.

If you still need Bitbucket sync functionality, the removed script should be simple enough to modify and run independently. The code is available [here](https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon/tree/6c4ff3fb479ddba6b51b43e2c710692a1a333559/services/api/src/bitbucket-sync). Similarly, if you need the Open Distro integration, you can modify and run it on-demand. The source code is available [here](https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon/blob/6c4ff3fb479ddba6b51b43e2c710692a1a333559/services/api/src/helpers/sync-groups-opendistro-security.ts).
