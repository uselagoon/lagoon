## Release Notes

### Lagoon Remote

This release of `lagoon-remote` now has support for Harbor version 2.13.x.

## Deprecations

### Lagoon Core

#### Internal Container Registry variables

In [2.17.0](./2.17.0.md) we announced Harbor support in the API as being deprecated, in [2.20.x](./2.20.1.md) we removed Harbor support from the API. Unforntunately the `internal_container_registry` variable scope still remained. This release cleans up that left over scope and removes it from the API, along with any variables associated in the database.

### Lagoon Remote

#### Lagoon Build Deploy QoS values

In [lagoon-build-deploy-0.37.0](https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-charts/releases/tag/lagoon-build-deploy-0.37.0), we deprecated some previously undocumented helm values related to QoS. These values, `lagoonFeatureFlagEnableQoS`, `QoSMaxBuilds`, and `QoSDefault` still work, but will be removed in the next release. If you were using these, check the [values file](https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-charts/blob/lagoon-build-deploy-0.37.0/charts/lagoon-build-deploy/values.yaml#L78-L94) for the replacement configuration options.
