## Release Notes

This release is a standard Lagoon release.

## Known Issues

The upgrade of `mariadb` client caused the API to throw errors when accessing environment storage `kibUsed` field.

## Deprecations

### Lagoon Core

#### Sync Scripts

We are deprecating the included Bitbucket and Open Distro sync scripts, which will be removed in a future release. Support for syncing to Opensearch is provided by [lagoon-opensearch-sync](https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-opensearch-sync).

#### UI

Development of the current UI has stopped and this will be the last release.
