## Configuration

To change an existing project to support active/standby you'll need to configure some project settings with the Lagoon API.

* `productionEnviromment` should be set to the branch name of the current active environment.
* `standbyProductionEnvironment` should be set to the branch name of the current environment that is in standby.

```graphql title="Update project settings"
mutation updateProject {
  updateProject(input:{
    id:1234
    patch:{
      productionEnvironment:"production-brancha"
      standbyProductionEnvironment:"production-branchb"
    }
  }){
    standbyProductionEnvironment
    name
    productionEnvironment
  }
}
```

### `.lagoon.yml` - `production_routes`

To configure a project for active/standby in the `.lagoon.yml` file, you'll need to configure the `production_routes` section with any routes you want to attach to the `active` environment, and any routes to the `standby` environment. During an active/standby switch, these routes will migrate between the two environments.

If you have two production environments, `production-brancha` and `production-branchb`, with the current active production environment as `production-brancha` then:

* Routes under `production_routes.active` will direct you to `production-brancha`.
* Routes under `production_routes.standby` will direct you to `production-branchb`.

During an active/standby switch, the routes will swap:

* Routes under `production_routes.active` will direct you to `production-branchb`.
* Routes under `production_routes.standby` will direct you to `production-brancha`.

```yaml title=".lagoon.yml"
production_routes:
  active:
    routes:
      - nginx:
        - example.com:
            tls-acme: 'false'
        - active.example.com:
            tls-acme: 'false'
  standby:
    routes:
      - nginx:
        - standby.example.com:
            tls-acme: 'false'
```

!!! Info
    Any routes that are under the section `environments..routes` will not be moved as part of active/standby. These routes will always be attached to the environment as defined. Ensure that if you do need a specific route to be migrated during an active/standby switch, that you remove them from the environments section and place them under the `production_routes` section specific to if it should be an active or standby route. [See more about routes in `.lagoon.yml`.](../using-lagoon-the-basics/lagoon-yml.md#routes)

## Triggering a switch event

### via the UI

To trigger the switching of environment routes, you can visit the standby environment in the Lagoon UI and click on the button labeled `Switch Active/Standby environments`. You will be prompted to confirm your action.

Once confirmed, it will take you to the tasks page where you can view the progress of the switch.

### via the API

To trigger an event to switch the environments, run the following GraphQL mutation. This will tell Lagoon to begin the process.

```graphql title="Active Standby Switch"
mutation ActiveStandby {
  switchActiveStandby(
    input:{
      project:{
        name:"drupal-example"
      }
    }
  ){
    id
    remoteId
  }
}
```

A task is created in the current active environment `tasks` tab when a switch event is triggered. You can check the status of the switch here.

Using the `remoteId` from the `switchActiveStandby` mutation, we can also check the status of the task.

```graphql title="Check task status"
query getTask {
  taskByRemoteId(id: "<remoteId>") {
    id
    name
    created
    started
    completed
    status
    logs
  }
}
```

## `drush` aliases

By default, projects will be created with the following aliases that will be available when active/standby is enabled on a project.

* `lagoon-production`
* `lagoon-standby`

The `lagoon-production` alias will point to whichever site is defined as `productionEnvironment`, and `lagoon-standby` will always point to the site that is defined as `standbyProductionEnvironment`.

These aliases are configurable by updating the project. Be aware that changing them may require you to update any scripts that rely on them.

```graphql title="Update Drush Aliases"
mutation updateProject {
  updateProject(input:{
    id:1234
    patch:{
      productionAlias:"custom-lagoon-production-alias"
      standbyAlias:"custom-lagoon-standby-alias"
    }
  }){
    productionAlias
    name
    standbyAlias
  }
}
```

## Disabling Active/Standby

You need to decide which of these 2 branches are the one you want to go forward with as being the main environment and then ensure it is set as the active branch (e.g `production-branchb`).

1. In your `.lagoon.yml` file in this (now active) branch, move the routes from the `production_routes.active.routes` section into the `environments.production-branchb` section. This will mean that they are then attached to the `production-branchb environment` only.
2. Once you've done this, you can delete the entire production_routes section from the `.lagoon.yml` file and re-deploy the production-branchb environment.
3. If you no longer need the other branch `production-brancha`, you can delete it.
4. If you keep the branch in Git, you should also remove the `production_routes` from that branch `.lagoon.yml` too, just to prevent any confusion. The branch will remain as `production` type unless you delete and redeploy it (wiping all storage and databases, etc).
5. Once you've got the project in a state where there is only the `production-branchb` production environment, and all the other environments are `development`, update the project to remove the `standbyProductionEnvironment` from the project so that the active/standby labels on the environments go away.

```graphql title="Turn off Active/Standby"
mutation updateProject {
  updateProject(input:{
    id:1234
    patch:{
      productionEnvironment:"production-branchb"
      standbyProductionEnvironment:""
    }
  }){
    standbyProductionEnvironment
    name
    productionEnvironment
  }
}
```

## Notes

When the active/standby trigger has been executed, the `productionEnvironment` and `standbyProductionEnvironments` will switch within the Lagoon API. Both environments are still classed as `production` environment types. We use the `productionEnvironment` to determine which one is labelled as `active`. For more information on the differences between environment types, read the [documentation for `environment types`](environment-types.md)

```graphql title="Get environments via GraphQL"
query projectByName {
  projectByName(name:"drupal-example"){
    productionEnvironment
    standbyProductionEnvironment
  }
}
```

Before switching environments:

```graphql title="Results of environment query"
{
  "data": {
    "projectByName": {
      "productionEnvironment": "production-brancha",
      "standbyProductionEnvironment": "production-branchb"
    }
  }
}
```

After switching environments:

```graphql title="Results of environment query"
{
  "data": {
    "projectByName": {
      "productionEnvironment": "production-branchb",
      "standbyProductionEnvironment": "production-brancha"
    }
  }
}
```
