# Install the Lagoon CLI

1. Check [https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-cli#install](https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-cli#install) on how to install for your operating system. For macOS and Linux, you can use Homebrew:
  1. `brew tap uselagoon/lagoon-cli`
  2. `brew install lagoon`
2. The CLI needs to know how to communicate with Lagoon, so run the following command:

    ```bash title="Lagoon config"
        lagoon config add \
            --graphql https://YOUR-API-URL/graphql \
            --ui https://YOUR-UI-URL \
            --hostname YOUR.SSH.IP \
            --lagoon YOUR-LAGOON-NAME \
            --port 22
    ```

3. Access Lagoon by authenticating with your SSH key.

   1. In the Lagoon UI (the URL is in `values.yml` if you forget), go to **Settings**.
   2. Add your public SSH key.
   3. You need to set the default Lagoon to _your_ Lagoon so that it doesn’t try to use the amazee.io defaults:

    ```bash title="Lagoon config"
        lagoon config default --lagoon <YOUR-LAGOON-NAME>
    ```

4. Now run `lagoon login`. Lagoon talks to SSH and authenticates against your public/private key pair, and gets a token for your username.

5. Verify via `lagoon whoami` that you are logged in.

!!! Info
     We don’t generally recommend using the Lagoon Admin role, but you’ll need to create an admin account at first to get started. Ideally, you’ll immediately create another account to work from which is _not_ an admin.
