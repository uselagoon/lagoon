# Lagoon Participation Guidelines

We ask that all members of our community, in any spaces, virtual or physical, adhere to our [Code of Conduct](../code-of-conduct.md).

_These guidelines have been adapted from [Drupal Diversity & Inclusion’s Participation Guidelines](https://www.drupaldiversity.com/docs/participant-guidelines)._

1. Listen actively, read carefully, and be understanding.
  * If joining a conversation, read the backlog. Give other Participants the opportunity to communicate effectively.
  * Assume good intent behind other Participants’ statements. The open-source software community is very diverse, with Participants from all over the globe. Be aware of cultural and linguistic quirks.
  * There are also many Participants who are new to this space. Assume that they have good intent but have not yet mastered the language or ideas. We want to help them!
2. Speak from your own experience, instead of generalizing. Recognize the worth of others’ experience. Try not to speak for others.
  * Use “I” instead of “they,” “we,” and “you”.
  * All Participants should recognize that other Participants have their own unique experiences.
  * Don’t invalidate another Participant’s story with your own spin on their experience. Instead, share your own story and experience.
3. Challenge ideas, feelings, concerns, or one another by asking questions. Refrain from personal attacks. Focus on ideas first.
  * Avoid verbal challenges, backhanded insults, gender/race/region stereotyping, etc.
4. Take part to the fullest of your ability and availability.
  * Community growth depends on the inclusion of individual voices. The channel wants you to speak up and speak out. Everyone has a different amount of time to contribute. We value participation here if you can give 5 minutes or 5 hours.
  * We do welcome those who quietly come to lurk and learn, or “lurk,” but please introduce yourself and say hello!
5. Accept that it is not always the goal to agree.
  * There are often many different “right” answers to technical issues, even though they may not work for your setup.
6. Be conscious of language differences and unintended connotations.
  * “Text is hard” - be aware that it is difficult to communicate effectively via text.
7. Acknowledge individuals’ identities.
  * Use stated names and pronouns. Do not challenge a person’s race, sexuality, disability, etc.
  * f you are unsure how to address someone, ask them discreetly and respectfully. For example, if you are unsure what pronouns to use, send a private message and ask. Using the correct pronouns will help others.
8. Some off-topic conversation is okay.
  * Some cross posting of announcements is okay. The following is not permitted:
    * Thread hijacking
    * Spamming
    * Commercial advertising
    * Overt self-promotion
    * Excessive going off-topic, especially during official meeting times or focused conversations
  * Consider announcing more appropriate places or times for in-depth off-topic conversations.
  * If you are not sure what’s appropriate, please contact an admin.
9.  Sharing content from inside Lagoon spaces must only be done with explicit consent. Any sharing must also be carefully considered, and without harassment or intent to harm any Participants.
  * This forum should be considered public. Assume that anyone can and may read anything posted here.
  * When sharing any Lagoon content, permission from all Participants must be obtained first. This applies whether content is quoted, summarized, or screenshotted. This includes sharing in any public medium: on Twitter, in a blog post, in an article, on a podcast, etc. These spaces are where the discussion and work in progress is taking place. Removing snippets of a conversation takes away context. This can distort and discourage discussion, especially when this is done without the goal of driving the Lagoon project forward.
  * As stated above, if you take screenshots and post them to social media or other forums, you must get permission from the person that posted it. When getting permission, include the option of removing identifying information. Permission is still needed even if identifying information is removed. This includes any content from Discord, Github, or any other Lagoon medium.
  * If you want to share something, just ask! “Hey, is it ok to share this on Twitter? I’m happy to credit you!”
  * If it is necessary for a participant to take a screenshot to report harassing behavior to Lagoon moderators, this may be done without obtaining permission. It is not, however, acceptable to take screenshots to publicly or privately shame an individual. Again, this applies only to reporting harassing behavior.
10. Address complaints between one another in the space when safe and appropriate.
  * When safe, try to clarify and engage in the space where the conflict happened. For example, in the Discord channel.
  * Ping admins or Community Manager (Alanna) when conflict is escalating.
  * Ask for help.
  * If the topic of conflict is off-topic for Lagoon, move the conversation to a more appropriate channel.

Additional considerations for in-person Lagoon spaces

1. Follow the event’s Code of Conduct, if there is one. If not, our Code of Conduct applies.
2. Do not touch people, their mobility devices, or other assistive equipment without their consent. If someone asks you to stop a certain behavior, stop immediately.
3. Report any issues to the event’s staff.
If an issue involves Lagoon team members, report to [uselagoon@amazee.io](mailto:uselagoon@amazee.io).

The Lagoon team reserves the right to terminate anyone’s access to the Lagoon spaces.
