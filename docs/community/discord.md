# Lagoon Community on Discord

Our official community meeting space is the Lagoon [Discord](https://discord.gg/te5hHe95JE).

We’re starting this community as a place for all Lagoon users to collaborate, solve problems, share ideas, and contribute back to the Lagoon project. We’re working to consolidate our community as it’s currently spread out over Slack and various other places. We also wanted to invite all of our users and customers to join so that everyone can benefit from the community, no matter how they’re using Lagoon.

_Please remember that this is not to replace your current support channels - those will remain the same. This is a place to connect with other users as well as the Lagoon maintainers._

We ask that all community members review our [Participation](participation.md) and [Moderation](moderation.md) Guidelines, as well as the [Code of Conduct](../code-of-conduct.md).

In addition to our [Zoom Community Hours](https://dev.to/uselagoon/lagoon-community-hours-2022-4bd4), we'll also be hosting Community Hours on Discord in 2023!
