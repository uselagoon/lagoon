# Logging

Lagoon provides access to the following logs via Kibana:

* Logs from the Kubernetes Routers, including every single HTTP and HTTPS request with:
  * Source IP
  * URL
  * Path
  * HTTP verb
  * Cookies
  * Headers
  * User agent
  * Project
  * Container name
  * Response size
  * Response time
* Logs from containers:
  * `stdout` and `stderr` messages
  * Container name
  * Project
* Lagoon logs:
  * Webhooks parsing
  * Build logs
  * Build errors
  * Any other Lagoon related logs
* Application logs:
  * For Drupal: install the [Lagoon Logs](https://www.drupal.org/project/lagoon_logs) module in order to receive logs from Drupal Watchdog.
  * For Laravel: install the [Lagoon Logs for Laravel](https://github.com/amazeeio/laravel_lagoon_logs) package.
  * For other workloads:
    * Send logs to `udp://application-logs.lagoon.svc:5140`
    * Ensure logs are structured as JSON encoded objects.
    * Ensure the `type` field contains the name of the Kubernetes namespace (`$LAGOON_PROJECT-$LAGOON_ENVIRONMENT`).

To access the logs, please check with your Lagoon administrator to get the URL for the Kibana route \(for amazee.io, this is [https://logs.amazeeio.cloud/](https://logs.amazeeio.cloud/)\).

Each Lagoon user account has their own login and will see the logs only for the projects to which they have access.

Each Lagoon user account also has their own **Kibana Tenant**, which means no saved searches or visualizations are shared with another account.
